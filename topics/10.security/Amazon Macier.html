        <h1>AWS Amazon Macie</h1>
        <p>AWS Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect sensitive data in AWS. Macie helps organizations comply with data protection regulations by automating the discovery of sensitive information such as PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and providing visibility into how that data is used and protected.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automated Data Discovery:</strong> Macie uses machine learning to automatically discover and classify sensitive data, such as PII and financial information.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Classification:</strong> Classifies data in Amazon S3 buckets, identifying sensitive information and applying appropriate access controls.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Data Types:</strong> Allows you to define and detect custom data types that are specific to your organization’s needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance and Reporting:</strong> Provides detailed reports and dashboards for compliance with data protection regulations, including GDPR and CCPA.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Access Monitoring:</strong> Monitors and alerts on data access patterns to detect any unusual or unauthorized access to sensitive data.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration with AWS Services:</strong> Integrates with AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and other AWS services to enhance visibility and compliance.</li>
