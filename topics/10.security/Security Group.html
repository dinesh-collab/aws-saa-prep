        <h1>AWS Security Groups</h1>
        <p>AWS Security Groups are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources, such as EC2 instances. They provide a way to manage access to resources by defining rules that allow or deny traffic based on criteria such as IP address, protocol, and port number.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stateful Filtering:</strong> Security Groups are stateful, meaning that if you allow an inbound request from a specific IP, the response is automatically allowed, regardless of outbound rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Rules-Based Control:</strong> Define rules to allow or deny traffic based on source IP, destination IP, port, and protocol. Each Security Group can have multiple inbound and outbound rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply to Multiple Resources:</strong> Security Groups can be applied to multiple EC2 instances, ensuring consistent security configurations across your infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Default Security Group:</strong> Each VPC comes with a default Security Group that allows all inbound and outbound traffic unless modified.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Updates:</strong> Changes to Security Group rules are automatically applied to all associated resources, providing flexibility in managing access control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application Segmentation:</strong> Use Security Groups to segment applications into different tiers (e.g., web servers, application servers, database servers) and control traffic flow between them.</li>
            <li><strong>Restricted Access:</strong> Restrict access to specific resources, such as databases, by allowing only traffic from trusted IP addresses or other Security Groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance and Security:</strong> Implement security controls to meet compliance requirements by defining precise access rules for sensitive resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing and Development:</strong> Use Security Groups to create isolated environments for testing and development, ensuring that only authorized traffic can access your instances.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
        <p>The following diagram illustrates how AWS Security Groups operate within a VPC:</p>
        <img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/75231/1700199439-aws-security-group-overview.png" alt="AWS Security Groups Architecture Diagram">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Group Rules:</strong> Define inbound and outbound rules that control traffic to and from instances.</li>
            <li><strong>Instance Association:</strong> Attach Security Groups to instances to enforce the defined rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Filtering:</strong> Security Groups filter traffic based on the rules applied, allowing or denying traffic as specified.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Updates:</strong> Changes to Security Group rules are automatically reflected in associated instances.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Integration with Other AWS Services</h2>
        <p>AWS Security Groups integrate with various AWS services to provide comprehensive security controls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AWS EC2:</strong> Control traffic to and from EC2 instances using Security Groups.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):</strong> Apply Security Groups to ELB to manage access to your load balancers and backend instances.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS RDS:</strong> Use Security Groups to control access to RDS instances, ensuring only authorized traffic can reach your databases.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Apply Security Groups to Lambda functions within a VPC to manage access to resources.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Elastic Beanstalk:</strong> Configure Security Groups for Elastic Beanstalk environments to manage access to your application instances.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Things to Remember for the Exam</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stateful vs. Stateless:</strong> Understand the difference between stateful Security Groups and stateless Network ACLs. Security Groups are stateful, meaning responses to allowed inbound traffic are automatically allowed.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule Management:</strong> Know how to configure inbound and outbound rules, and how to manage multiple rules within a Security Group.</li>
            <li><strong>Default Security Group:</strong> Be familiar with the default Security Group settings and how they apply to instances in a new VPC.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Association:</strong> Understand how to associate Security Groups with different AWS resources, including EC2 instances, ELB, RDS, and Lambda functions.</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Flow Control:</strong> Review how Security Groups manage traffic flow between different tiers of an application and across multiple resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Group Limits:</strong> Be aware of the default limits for Security Groups, including the maximum number of rules and Security Groups per instance.</li>
        </ul>
