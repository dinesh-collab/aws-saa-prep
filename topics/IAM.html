    <h2>AWS IAM - Certified Solutions Architect Exam Guide</h2>
    
    <h2>Key IAM Concepts for the Exam</h2>
    
    <h3>IAM Users and Groups</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Users:</strong> Individual identities with specific permissions to access AWS resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Groups:</strong> Collections of IAM users that share the same permissions. Users inherit the permissions assigned to the group.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>IAM Roles</h3>
    <p>Roles are used to delegate permissions to trusted entities, such as AWS services, users, or applications. Roles do not have long-term credentials; instead, they are used to assume temporary credentials.</p>
    
    <h3>IAM Policies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Managed Policies:</strong> AWS provides pre-built policies that can be attached to users, groups, or roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Inline Policies:</strong> Policies that are directly embedded into a user, group, or role.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Policies:</strong> JSON-based policies that define granular permissions based on actions, resources, and conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Security Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Least Privilege Principle:</strong> Assign the minimum permissions necessary for users or services to perform their tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Enforce MFA for root accounts and sensitive operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Password Policies:</strong> Set password complexity requirements, expiration periods, and enforce the use of strong passwords.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Cross-Account Access</h3>
    <p>Use IAM roles to allow users from one AWS account to access resources in another account securely.</p>
    
    <h3>Federation and Identity Providers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Federation:</strong> Integrate with external identity providers (like SAML or OIDC) to grant users from those providers access to AWS resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Identity Federation:</strong> Used for applications like mobile or web apps to authenticate users via social identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Service-Linked Roles</h3>
    <p>Roles that are predefined by AWS services to allow them to perform actions on your behalf. These roles are managed entirely by the service, reducing the complexity of managing permissions.</p>
    
    <h3>Resource-Based Policies</h3>
    <p>Unlike user-based policies, resource-based policies are attached directly to AWS resources like S3 buckets, SNS topics, or SQS queues, defining who can access those resources and what actions they can perform.</p>
    
    <h2>Exam Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the <strong>JSON structure</strong> of IAM policies, including elements like <code>Effect</code>, <code>Action</code>, <code>Resource</code>, and <code>Condition</code>.</li>
        <li>Be familiar with <strong>common use cases</strong> for IAM, such as setting up cross-account roles, creating least-privilege policies, and implementing MFA.</li>
        <li>Know how to configure <strong>federated access</strong> and how IAM integrates with other AWS services for authentication and authorization.</li>
        <li>Scenarios on the exam may require you to identify the correct IAM setup for a given use case, so practice interpreting and creating policies.</li>
    </ul>
