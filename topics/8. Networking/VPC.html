        <h1>AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</h1>
        <p>AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. VPC allows complete control over your virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subnets:</strong> VPCs can be divided into public and private subnets. Public subnets allow access to the internet, while private subnets do not.</li>
            <li><strong>Route Tables:</strong> Control where network traffic is directed within your VPC. Each subnet must be associated with a route table.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Gateway (IGW):</strong> Attach an IGW to a VPC to allow communication between instances in the VPC and the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):</strong> Provide stateless traffic filtering for subnets within your VPC.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Groups:</strong> Provide stateful filtering of inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.</li>
            <li><strong>VPN Gateway:</strong> Establish secure connections between your on-premises network and your AWS VPC using a VPN connection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
        <p>The following diagram illustrates how AWS VPC components work together to provide a secure and scalable virtual network:</p>
        <img src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/custom-vpc.JPG" alt="AWS VPC Architecture Diagram">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>VPC:</strong> The main container for your subnets, route tables, security groups, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Subnets:</strong> Divide your VPC into smaller sections, each containing resources like EC2 instances.</li>
            <li><strong>Route Tables:</strong> Determine how traffic is directed between subnets and to external networks.</li>
            <li><strong>IGW:</strong> Enables communication between your VPC and the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>NAT Gateway:</strong> Allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet without exposing them to incoming traffic from the internet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Application Hosting:</strong> Host web applications in a public subnet and databases in a private subnet, ensuring separation of public and internal-facing resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud Architectures:</strong> Extend your on-premises network into the cloud by creating a secure VPN connection to your VPC.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Tier Applications:</strong> Implement multiple layers of security by placing different application components in separate subnets.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolated Environments:</strong> Create multiple VPCs to isolate different environments such as development, staging, and production.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Integration with Other AWS Services</h2>
        <p>AWS VPC integrates with various AWS services to enhance security, scalability, and functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AWS EC2:</strong> Deploy instances in your VPC, associating them with specific subnets and security groups.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Run serverless applications within your VPC, controlling access to VPC resources.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS RDS:</strong> Deploy databases in a private subnet for enhanced security and control.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Direct Connect:</strong> Establish a dedicated network connection between your on-premises environment and your VPC for low-latency, high-throughput connectivity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Things to Remember for the Exam</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subnet Types:</strong> Understand the difference between public and private subnets and when to use each.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Groups vs. NACLs:</strong> Know that security groups are stateful and operate at the instance level, while NACLs are stateless and operate at the subnet level.</li>
            <li><strong>VPC Peering:</strong> Remember that VPC Peering connections allow resources in different VPCs to communicate as if they are within the same network.</li>
            <li><strong>VPN Gateway:</strong> Understand how to set up a VPN connection to connect your on-premises network to your VPC securely.</li>
            <li><strong>NAT Gateway vs. Bastion Host:</strong> Know the differences between NAT Gateways for outbound internet access from private subnets and Bastion Hosts for secure SSH access to instances in private subnets.</li>
        </ul>
