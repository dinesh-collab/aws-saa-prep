        <img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2021/08/02/Fig1-S3-Object-1024x540.png" alt="Amazon S3 Architecture Diagram">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Buckets:</strong> Buckets are the fundamental containers in S3 where objects (files and metadata) are stored. Each object is identified by a unique key within a bucket.</li>
            <li><strong>Objects:</strong> An object consists of the data (file) and metadata, which includes details like the creation date, version ID, and access permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Classes:</strong> S3 offers various storage classes that optimize costs based on access frequency and durability requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> S3 supports bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs), and IAM policies to manage permissions and control access to buckets and objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> S3 supports server-side encryption (SSE) with S3-managed keys (SSE-S3), AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS), and customer-provided keys (SSE-C).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Replication:</strong> S3 can replicate objects automatically to another bucket within the same or different AWS Region using cross-region replication (CRR) or same-region replication (SRR).</li>
        </ul>
