        <h3>Why AWS Organizations is Important for Exam Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding AWS Organizations is critical for managing complex environments with multiple AWS accounts. For the AWS SAA-C03 certification, focus on how AWS Organizations can be used to streamline account management, enforce security policies, and optimize costs. Remember key concepts like SCPs, consolidated billing, and resource sharing, as they are likely to appear in exam scenarios related to multi-account management and governance.
